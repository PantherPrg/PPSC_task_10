# PPSC_task_10: Palindrome Aliens
**| difficulty: 3/10 |**

You were hired as a secret agent for the MIB to go undercover as a middle school teacher. Why? We have been made aware of alien invaders that have been disguised as school kids to infiltrate the Earth. After several weeks of investigation, a pattern was found. All of the alien childrens' names are palindromes, meaning that they are spelled the same from right to left and left to right. Write a program to detect the aliens as they scan their IDs entering school. 

Alien name example: 
"Stanley Yelnats"

__________________________________________________________________________________
**Input**:
List Names (A list of strings of the school childrens' names)
__________________________________________________________________________________
**Output**:
The list of alien childrens' names as newlines in your answer string. 

"Stanley Yelnats
Paul Laup
Joshua Auhsoj
Anthony ynohtnA
"

Make sure to add a newline at the end of your answer for it to match the answer format.

This problem deals with lists, strings, character capitalization, character replacement, etc. Pretty cool. **Do your research, google is your friend.**

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blatner, or any other staff member for assistance. We would be able to go over them during the club. **It can be an anonymous request if you would like.**
